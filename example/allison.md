In this course, students will be required to write a term paper on the use(s) of a specific plant species. The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize students with the uses of plants they may encounter in their everyday lives. Each student will choose a plant species of their choice, but it must be approved by the instructor to ensure that each student explores a different plant.

To begin their research, students are encouraged to consult three reserve books that will provide a good starting point. One of these books is Moerman's work, which is considered the definitive resource on the ethnobotanical uses of North American plants. The other two books by Kindscher provide valuable information on plants used by Native Americans in the prairie region and Great Plains.

The term paper should include a description of the natural history of the chosen plant species, including where it is found and how abundant it is. Students should also explore how the plant was used by Native Americans and any potential uses it may have today.

To help students with their term paper, the instructor has set the following deadlines:

1. Choose plant species - due by January 24 in class
2. Term paper outline (including literature to be cited) - due February 14
3. Finished term paper - due March 7

By following these deadlines, students will have ample time to conduct thorough research and produce a well-written term paper on the chosen plant species.
