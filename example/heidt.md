Based on the instructions provided, it seems you're looking to understand a note-taking research skill for a class assignment which focuses on a reading or a set of readings. Let's break down the process:

### 1. **Preparation**

**Materials Needed:** 
- The article(s) or chapter(s) you're assigned
- A computer (for digital note-taking)
- Notebook (for hard copy notes)

### 2. **Procedure**

#### a) **Citation Information**
Before diving into the content, begin by jotting down the full citation of the chapter or article. Include:
- Author's full name
- Title of the chapter/article
- Name of the book or journal (if applicable)
- Publisher
- Year of publication
- Page range (start and end)

#### b) **Thesis Statement**
As you start reading, identify the main idea or the thesis of the article or chapter. This is typically the author's primary argument or claim. This could be explicitly stated in the text, or you might have to infer it based on the content.

#### c) **Structure and Arguments**
Outline the structure of the article or chapter:
1. Identify subheadings or “mini-chapters” if provided.
2. If no subheadings are given, divide the text into sections based on themes or ideas.
3. For each section, write a brief summary that captures the main idea.
4. Examine how each section supports or relates to the thesis.
5. Identify the transitional ideas or links between sections.

#### d) **Quotes**
Choose 3-5 (or more) quotes that are crucial to understanding the text. Make sure these quotes are relevant and that they illustrate the main points or arguments. Each quote should be referenced with its corresponding page number.

#### e) **Page References**
Ensure that for all the information above – thesis, structure, and quotes – you've noted down the specific page numbers. This makes referencing easier later on.

### 3. **Completion**

Once you've gathered all the information:

1. Compile it into a concise format (max two pages).
2. Transfer your notes to a digital format if handwritten and submit it via Google Classroom.
3. Print a hard copy to bring to class.

### 4. **Evaluation**

Based on the rubric:

- **Citation Info:** 2 points for complete and correct citation details.
- **Thesis Statement:** 5 points for a clear, concise thesis.
- **Structure and Arguments:** 5 points for a well-outlined structure.
- **Quotes:** 5 points for relevant, well-chosen quotes.
- **Page references:** 5 points for accurate page references.

### 5. **Revision**

If you didn't receive full credit, analyze the feedback, make necessary revisions, and resubmit for an improved grade.

### Tips:
1. Skim the article or chapter first to get a general idea before diving deep.
2. While it's good to have a sample format, it's okay to personalize your notes in a way that makes them more understandable and useful for you.
3. Always review and revise your notes for clarity and accuracy.
