ENVS 101 has weekly short writing assignments, which are probably the most plagiarize-able assignments that I give. A few of the prompts are here:
1. We've spent the past two weeks discussing population growth, consumption, complexity, and agriculture. Use this information to explain:
If someone you know was concerned about the human population reaching 10+ billion people by approximately 2050, because they were worried about us reaching the carrying capacity of our planet, how would you respond? Make sure to include data that we have examined as part of our lectures and readings (you only need to cite if you are using additional resources).
2. We have recently talked about the idea of "stakeholder involvement". This is the idea that policies (including environmental policies) should be created through a collaboration with the people who will be affected by those policies.
Please write between 500-1000 words on a time from your own life when you have had to follow a rule (for example, a school rule, a college rule, a family rule, work rule, etc) which was created without collaboration from you. How might the rule have been improved if you had been able to collaborate with creating it? What might have been the other beneficial impacts of greater collaboration?
