CS 205: Algorithm design and analysis Fall Term, 2022
Homework 2
Due: Friday 9/23 at 11:59pm
Complete the following. Submit using Google Classroom if at all possible in a format that is easy for the TAs to read such as Google Docs, PDF, Word documents, JPEG (e.g. a picture of a paper solution), or text files. The file(s) should be named based on your name as displayed in Google Classroom. If multiple files are used, please number them.
1. (8 points) Draw the result of adding the following values to an initially empty AVL tree: 205, 309, 330, 142, 141, 214, 220, and 208. These values should be added one at a time in the given order. Rebalancing operations are part of the insertion so the tree should be rebalanced after each operation. Show the balanced tree after each insertion (8 figures) at a minimum; you may also show the tree before the rotations if you wish.
2. (10 points) Use induction to prove the following identity: 1/(1x3)+1/(3x5)+1/(5x7)+...+ 1/((2n-1)(2n+1)) = n/(2n+1)
3. (10 points) Complete case 2a of the proof that the algorithm from class restores the AVL tree property. The steps of this proof are shown on the slides so you just need to provide the justifications for each step.
