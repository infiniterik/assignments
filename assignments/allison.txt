Biology 320 – Ethnobotany
Term Paper
Each student will write a term paper that examines the use(s) of a particular plant species. I want you to study local plants because I want you to develop familiarity with the uses of plants you are likely to encounter in your everyday life. Each student will select a plant species of his/her choice, but I must approve the plant because I want each student to be exploring a different plant. Three reserve books will provide a good starting point for you. Moerman’s book, in particular, is considered THE definitive work on ethnobotanical uses of North American plants. The books by Kindscher provide good information about plants used by Native Americans living in the prairie region and Great Plans. The paper should describe the natural history of the plant, where it is found, how abundant it is, how it was used by Native Americans, and any potential uses the plant may have today.
To assist you in preparing your term paper, I have set the following deadlines: Choose plant species - due by January 24 in class
