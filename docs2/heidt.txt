## Assignment Summary

The assignment requires students to read assigned articles or chapters and write a summary of their notes. The summary should be a maximum of two pages long and include the following elements:

1. **Citation Information**: Include complete citation information for each article or chapter to save time later when citing sources in a research paper.

2. **Thesis Statement**: Identify the main idea or thesis of the article or chapter. Look for a sentence or a few sentences that clearly lay out the author's original interpretation.

3. **Structure and Arguments**: Determine the structure of the article or chapter. If the author has provided subheadings or "mini-chapters," note them down. If not, create your own subheadings to divide the text into sections. Describe the focus of each section and how they relate to each other. Also, analyze how each section supports the thesis.

4. **Quotes**: Select 3-5 important quotes from the text, in addition to the thesis statement. These quotes should help in understanding the text better. If possible, include a key sentence or quote from each section of the text to provide context.

5. **Page References**: Provide page references for all the information mentioned above. This will make your notes more useful when referring back to specific sections.
