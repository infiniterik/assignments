# A Brief Introduction to Game Theory

Game theory is a branch of economics and mathematics that studies decision-making and strategic behavior in situations where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple players. Game theorists build models as a way to study player behavior under certain constraints. Insights gained from these models can be used to design social, political, or economic mechanisms to encourage behaviors that are advantageous in a variety of situations.

For example, the Tragedy of the Commons describes a game in which multiple individuals must decide how much of a shared resource to use, with the outcome depending on all their decisions. The original example, dating back to 1833 by economist William Forster Lloyd, describes the destruction of grazing fields which were considered common land. Players would bring cattle to graze on the land for free but failed to maintain the land resulting in the depletion of the field. This is also descriptive of modern concerns with industrial pollution destroying shared environments.

The Tragedy of the Commons describes how untempered individualistic behavior can result in over-utilization or neglect and, ultimately, the loss of this shared resource, resulting in a net negative outcome for all players, whereas enacting certain limits or socio-economic rules governing the usage of the shared resource can result in lower immediate gains for individuals in exchange for a more stable long-term outcome.

Game theorists abstract problems such as the Tragedy of the Commons and construct a model of players, incentives, and constraints to determine optimal strategies and predict outcomes. The study of these problems provides insights into the nature of cooperation, competition, and conflict, and has important implications for fields such as economics, political science, and psychology. More recently, game theory has even been used to design defense mechanisms in Cybersecurity applications.

## Mathematical Foundations
The mathematical concepts required to study game theory vary depending on the level and depth of the study. However, here are some of the most important mathematical concepts involved in game theory:

* Linear Algebra: To represent and analyze the payoffs for each player in a game.
* Probability theory: To analyze the probabilities of different outcomes in games with random elements.
* Optimization theory: To determine the best strategies for each player, given the payoffs and constraints of the game.
* Topology and fixed point theory: To analyze the stability and equilibria of games.
* Graph theory: To represent and analyze the relationships between players in games.
* Dynamic programming: To analyze the best strategies for games that involve multiple stages and decision-making over time.

In addition to these mathematical concepts, a solid understanding of logic, set theory, and mathematical proofs is also important for studying game theory. It is also useful to have a basic understanding of microeconomics, as game theory is often used to study economic scenarios and decision-making in markets.

## A Brief outline of game theoretic concepts

Player behaviors and payoffs are often modeled as constraints in a system of equations. This allows game theorists to identify optimal strategies and expected benefits from strategies by solving the system of equations. The formal modeling aspect also allows game theorists to provide proofs and identify invariants in player behavior under certain classes of conditions. As a result, game theory can be used in a variety of fields which study human behavior, including economic prediction, psychology, sociology, and even warfare.

Assumptions are made in order to simplify the analysis of games and make predictions about player behavior. However, in real-world situations, players may not always behave according to these assumptions, and deviations from these assumptions can have a significant impact on player decision making. As a result, game theorists often explore how relaxing or modifying constraints on player behavior changes the outcome of the game.

### Players
Players are individuals or entities that make decisions and interact with each other. The study of game theory assumes certain characteristics about the players, which include:
* Rationality: Players are assumed to act rationally, meaning they make decisions that maximize their own benefits and minimize their losses.
* Self-interest: Players are assumed to act in their own self-interest, meaning they prioritize their own goals and objectives over those of others.
* Complete information: Players have complete information about the game, meaning they know all the rules, payoffs, and strategies available to them.
* Consistency: Players are assumed to be consistent in their behavior, meaning they make the same decisions in similar situations.
* Predictable behavior: Players are assumed to behave in predictable ways, meaning their decisions can be predicted based on their objectives and preferences.
* Individual decision-making: Players make decisions independently, without coordination or communication with other players.
* Finite number of players: The number of players involved in the game is finite and known.

### Payoffs
Payoffs refer to the outcomes of the game for each player. The study of game theory makes several assumptions about payoffs, including:

* Well-defined payoffs: Payoffs are assumed to be well-defined and measurable, meaning that each player can quantify the benefits or costs associated with each outcome.
* Self-interest: Players are assumed to act in their own self-interest, meaning they prioritize their own payoffs over those of others.
* Consistency: Payoffs are assumed to be consistent, meaning that the same outcomes will result from the same strategies in similar situations.
* Complete information: Players have complete information about the payoffs, meaning they know all the outcomes associated with each strategy.
* Transitivity: The preferences of players are assumed to be transitive, meaning that if player A prefers outcome 1 to outcome 2, outcome 2 to outcome 3, then player A must prefer outcome 1 to outcome 3.
* Maximization: Players are assumed to act in order to maximize their payoffs, meaning they will choose the strategy that results in the highest payoff for themselves.

### Strategies
Strategies refer to the plans of action chosen by players. The study of game theory makes several assumptions about strategies, including:

* Complete set of strategies: Each player has a complete set of strategies available to them, and they can choose any strategy from this set.
* Determinacy: Strategies are assumed to be well-defined and determinate, meaning that each strategy has a specific outcome for each player.
* Consistency: Players are assumed to follow their chosen strategy consistently, meaning they will not change their behavior mid-game.
* Independent choice: Players are assumed to make independent choices about their strategies, meaning that the choices of one player do not affect the strategies chosen by other players.
* Nash Equilibrium: In a Nash Equilibrium, each player's strategy is the best response to the strategies chosen by the other players.
* Dominant strategy: A dominant strategy is a strategy that is always the best choice, regardless of the strategies chosen by the other players.
* Mixed strategies: Players can choose mixed strategies, meaning they randomly select strategies from a set of options with specific probabilities.

### Nash Equilibrium
The Nash Equilibrium is a key concept in game theory, named after Nobel Prize-winning economist John Nash. In game theory, a Nash Equilibrium is a state in which each player's strategy is the best response to the strategies of the other players. In other words, no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.

To be in a Nash Equilibrium, each player must make a decision that maximizes their own payoff, taking into account the strategies chosen by the other players. The Nash Equilibrium is considered to be a stable state of the game, as no player has an incentive to change their strategy.

The Nash Equilibrium is an important concept in game theory because it provides insight into how players will behave in a given situation. By understanding the Nash Equilibrium, researchers can make predictions about how players will interact with each other and what the outcome of the game will be.

It's important to note that a game can have multiple Nash Equilibria, and that in some cases, a Nash Equilibrium may result in a sub-optimal outcome for all players. Additionally, the Nash Equilibrium assumes that players have complete information about the game and make rational decisions, which may not always be the case in real-world situations.

### Dominant Strategies
A dominant strategy is a strategy that is always the best choice for a player, regardless of the strategies chosen by the other players. A dominant strategy is considered to be a player's optimal choice, as it leads to the highest payoff for that player, no matter what the other players do.

In other words, a dominant strategy is a strategy that results in the highest payoff for a player, regardless of the strategies chosen by the other players. This is in contrast to a Nash Equilibrium, where each player's strategy is the best response to the strategies of the other players, but not necessarily the optimal choice for each player.

The existence of a dominant strategy can simplify the analysis of a game, as it eliminates the need to consider the strategies chosen by the other players when making decisions. However, not all games have a dominant strategy, and in some cases, players may not have a clear choice that results in the highest payoff.

In situations where a dominant strategy does not exist, players may use a mixed strategy, where they randomly select strategies from a set of options with specific probabilities, in order to maximize their payoffs. It's important to note that the existence of a dominant strategy does not guarantee that players will choose it, as players may not always act rationally or have complete information about the game.

### Cooperative Games
Cooperative games are a type of game in game theory in which players work together to achieve a common goal. In cooperative games, players can pool their resources and make decisions collectively to maximize their combined payoff, rather than competing with each other for individual rewards.

In contrast to non-cooperative games, where players act independently and make decisions based on self-interest, cooperative games allow for the possibility of joint gain through cooperation. This means that players can potentially achieve outcomes that are better for all of them than if they acted independently.

Cooperative games can take many forms, including collective decision-making, resource allocation, and negotiation. They are often used to study issues related to cooperation, such as cooperation in international relations, environmental protection, and business.

In cooperative games, players are often able to form coalitions, or groups of players who work together to achieve their goals. The formation of coalitions can be influenced by factors such as trust, communication, and fairness, and can have a significant impact on the outcome of the game.

It's important to note that cooperation in cooperative games is not always guaranteed, as players may still act in their own self-interest. However, the study of cooperative games provides valuable insights into the conditions under which cooperation can be achieved and maintained.

### Zero-sum games
Zero-sum games are games in which one player's gain is exactly balanced by the loss of the other player. In zero-sum games, the total payoff is fixed, and any gain by one player must be offset by an equal loss by the other player. This means that the players are in direct competition with each other, and one player's gain can only come at the expense of the other player.

Cooperative games, on the other hand, allow for the possibility of joint gain through cooperation. In cooperative games, players can pool their resources and make decisions collectively to maximize their combined payoff, rather than competing with each other for individual rewards. This means that players can potentially achieve outcomes that are better for all of them than if they acted independently.

One key difference between cooperative games and zero-sum games is that in cooperative games, players can form coalitions, or groups of players who work together to achieve their goals. The formation of coalitions can be influenced by factors such as trust, communication, and fairness, and can have a significant impact on the outcome of the game.

Another key difference is that cooperation in cooperative games is not always guaranteed, as players may still act in their own self-interest. In contrast, in zero-sum games, players are in direct competition with each other and are motivated by self-interest.

In summary, cooperative games and zero-sum games are different in their assumptions about the nature of player interaction, the possibility of joint gain, and the formation of coalitions. The study of cooperative games provides valuable insights into the conditions under which cooperation can be achieved and maintained, while the study of zero-sum games provides insights into the nature of competition and conflict.

### The Prisoners Dilemma
The prisoner's dilemma is a long standing interrogation tactic that was was formalized as a concept in game theory by mathematician Albert Tucker in 1950. The concept was initially used to demonstrate the tension between individual self-interest and cooperative behavior in economic situations.

In the decades following its introduction, the prisoner's dilemma has been used as a model to study a wide range of social and economic issues, including cooperation and competition in business, environmental protection, and international relations.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the prisoner's dilemma became a popular topic of study in the fields of psychology and sociology, as researchers sought to understand the factors that influence cooperative behavior. During this time, the concept was expanded to include the study of social norms, communication, and trust, as well as the use of punishment and incentives to encourage cooperative behavior.

The game is set up as such, two suspects are arrested and separated, unable to communicate with each other. Each suspect is given the option to confess or remain silent. The payoffs are as follows:

* If both suspects remain silent, they are each charged with a minor offense and receive a small penalty.
* If one suspect confesses and the other remains silent, the confessing suspect goes free, and the silent suspect receives a severe penalty.
* If both suspects confess, they both receive a moderate penalty.

In the prisoner's dilemma, confessing is the dominant strategy for each player, meaning that each player has an incentive to confess, regardless of what the other player does. This is because confessing results in a lower penalty than remaining silent if the other player confesses, and results in the best outcome if the other player remains silent.

The proof of the dominant strategy is as follows:

* If the other player remains silent, confessing results in a lower penalty than remaining silent.
* If the other player confesses, confessing results in a lower penalty than remaining silent.
Therefore, confessing is the dominant strategy for each player, regardless of the strategy chosen by the other player.

The prisoner's dilemma is a demonstration of the tension between individual self-interest and cooperative behavior, as each player has an incentive to confess, resulting in a worse outcome for both players compared to if they both remained silent. The prisoner's dilemma is often used to demonstrate the importance of trust, cooperation, and communication in situations where individual self-interest conflicts with the interests of the group.

### Conclusion

In this article we have summarized some of the basic principles of game theory. With this knowledge, we can begin to analyze and approach problems of socio-economic importance, as well as international relations, climate change, and even cyber-security. Problems such as the Tragedy of the Commons and Prisoners Dilemma show us how determining and enforcing a payoff scheme can incentivize unknown players to self-select into desirable patterns of behavior in a variety of applications. This can be more effective than attempting to educate and enforce cooperation because we assume that all players act in their own self-interest.
